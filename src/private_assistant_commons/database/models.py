"""Database models for the global device registry.

This module provides SQLModel table definitions for managing the global device registry
that enables pattern-based device matching across all skills in the Private Assistant ecosystem.

The registry consists of four main entities:
- Room: Physical locations where devices are placed
- Skill: Skills that own and manage devices
- DeviceType: Types of devices (e.g., light, switch, media_player)
- GlobalDevice: Devices registered in the global registry with pattern matching support

Skills can register their devices in the global registry and publish updates via MQTT
to the 'assistant/global_device_update' topic, triggering the intent engine to refresh
its device cache.

Example:
    from private_assistant_commons.database import Room, Skill, DeviceType, GlobalDevice

    # Create a room
    bedroom = Room(name="bedroom")

    # Create a skill
    switch_skill = Skill(name="switch-skill")

    # Create a device type
    light_type = DeviceType(name="light")

    # Register a device
    device = GlobalDevice(
        device_type_id=light_type.id,
        name="bedroom lamp",
        pattern=["bedroom lamp", "lamp in bedroom", "bedroom light"],
        room_id=bedroom.id,
        skill_id=switch_skill.id
    )

    """Device registry model for pattern-based device matching.

    The global device registry enables the intent engine to match user commands to
    specific devices instead of just generic device types. Each device has multiple
    pattern strings that can be used to identify it in natural language commands.

    Example:
        A device with name="bedroom lamp" might have patterns:
        ["bedroom lamp", "lamp in bedroom", "bedroom light", "lamp bedroom"]

        This allows matching commands like:
        - "Turn on bedroom lamp"
        - "Turn on the lamp in bedroom"
        - "Switch bedroom light on"

    Attributes:
        id: Unique identifier for the device
        device_type_id: Foreign key to the device type
        name: Human-readable device name
        pattern: List of pattern strings for matching natural language commands
        device_attributes: Skill-specific metadata (MQTT paths, templates, state mappings, etc.)

        skill_id: Foreign key to the skill that manages this device
        created_at: Timestamp when the device was registered
        updated_at: Timestamp when the device was last modified

    Note:
        Skills should publish to 'assistant/global_device_update' MQTT topic when
        devices are added, updated, or removed to trigger cache refresh in the
