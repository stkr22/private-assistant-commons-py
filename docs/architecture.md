# Private Assistant Commons - Architecture Guide

## System Overview

Private Assistant Commons is a foundational library for building a distributed, local voice assistant system. The system processes voice commands for home automation through modular "skills" that communicate via MQTT messaging.

### Key Characteristics

- **Local & Private**: Runs entirely on local infrastructure (typically Kubernetes)
- **Distributed Processing**: No central coordinator - skills decide independently whether to handle requests
- **MQTT-Based**: All communication via structured MQTT messages using Pydantic models
- **Async & Concurrent**: Built on asyncio with TaskGroup for concurrent operations
- **Extensible**: Skills can be added/removed without system changes

## Core Architectural Patterns

### 1. Distributed Skill Processing

**No Central Coordinator**: Originally the system had a coordinator that selected which skill should handle each request. This was removed to reduce latency.

**Current Flow**:
1. Intent Analysis Engine processes voice command → `IntentRequest` (containing `ClassifiedIntent` + `ClientRequest`)
2. All skills receive the message via MQTT
3. Each skill calculates its certainty score independently
4. Skills with certainty ≥ threshold process the request
5. Multiple skills can respond to the same request (rare but acceptable)

**Benefits**:
- Lower latency (no coordinator round-trip)
- Better fault tolerance (no single point of failure)
- Simpler architecture

### 2. Message-Driven Communication

All system components communicate via MQTT using structured Pydantic models:

- **ClientRequest**: Original voice command + metadata (id, text, room, output_topic)
- **ClassifiedIntent**: Classified intent type with confidence score and extracted entities
- **IntentRequest**: Combined wrapper containing both ClassifiedIntent and ClientRequest
- **Entity**: Extracted component with type, normalization, and linking capabilities
- **Response**: Skill output with optional audio alerts

### 3. Intent-Based Processing with Context-Aware Confidence

Skills configure their intent handling via simple instance attributes set in `__init__`:

#### Step 1: Intent Matching with Per-Intent Thresholds
Skills define supported intents as a dict mapping intent types to confidence thresholds:

```python
def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    # Per-intent confidence thresholds
    self.supported_intents = {
        IntentType.DEVICE_ON: 0.8,    # Standard threshold
        IntentType.DEVICE_OFF: 0.8,   # Standard threshold
        IntentType.DEVICE_SET: 0.9,   # Higher threshold for critical actions
    }
```

The BaseSkill automatically filters out unsupported intent types for efficient processing.

#### Step 2: Confidence Evaluation
The intent engine assigns confidence scores based on pattern matching quality:
- **1.0** - Multi-word keyword + context hints (e.g., "turn on" + "lights")
- **0.9** - Multi-word keyword alone OR single keyword + multiple context hints
- **0.8** - Single keyword + single context hint OR all pattern keywords present
- **0.5** - Single keyword match without context
- **0.3** - Context hints without keywords

Skills can define **confidence modifiers** to lower thresholds for contextually related follow-up commands:

```python
    # Confidence modifiers for context-aware processing
    # Key is the intent being impacted, value is list of modifiers
    self.confidence_modifiers = {
        IntentType.DEVICE_OFF: [
            ConfidenceModifier(
                trigger_intent=IntentType.DEVICE_ON,  # If this was recently handled
                lowers_threshold_for=IntentType.DEVICE_OFF,  # Lower threshold for this
                reduced_threshold=0.5,  # Down to this level
                time_window_seconds=300  # Within this window
            )
        ]
    }
```

The dict structure allows efficient O(1) lookup by target intent, and supports multiple modifiers per intent. This improves conversation flow - if a user just said "turn on the lights", a follow-up "turn them off" with lower confidence will still be accepted.

#### Step 3: Entity Matching (Optional)
Skills can optionally define entity matchers for additional validation:

```python
    # Optional: Entity matchers for validation
    self.entity_matchers = {
        "devices": lambda devices: any("light" in d.raw_text.lower() for d in devices)
    }
```

If no entity matchers are defined, all intents that pass the confidence check are processed.

### 4. Location-Aware Processing

The system distinguishes between command origin and target:

- **ClientRequest.room**: Where the command was spoken ("kitchen")
- **Entity(type=ROOM)**: Target locations extracted as entities ("living room" for "turn off lights in living room")
- **Fallback behavior**: Skills use origin room when no target specified

### 5. Task Management & Concurrency

Skills use `asyncio.TaskGroup` for concurrent operations:

- **MQTT message handling**: Main loop processes incoming messages
- **Background tasks**: Timers, delayed responses, concurrent API calls
- **Lifecycle management**: Tasks are properly cleaned up on skill shutdown

**Common Patterns**:
```python
# Spawn a timer task
self.add_task(self._timer_task(duration, message))

# Background API call
self.add_task(self._fetch_weather_data())
```

    User->>LC: Speaks: "Turn off lights in living room"
    LC->>VB: Audio stream (WebSocket)

    LS->>LS: calculate_certainty() = 0.95
    TS->>TS: calculate_certainty() = 0.1
    
    Note over LS: certainty ≥ threshold (0.8)
    LS->>LS: process_request()
    LS->>MB: Response: "Turning off living room lights"<br/>topic: client/output/xyz
    
    Note over TS: certainty < threshold - ignored
    
    MB->>VB: Response message (subscribed to output topics)
    VB->>TTS: Response text + alert config
    TTS->>VB: Generated audio
    VB->>LC: Audio response + alerts (WebSocket)
    LC->>User: Plays audio: "Turning off living room lights"
```

**Detailed Flow:**
1. **Voice Capture**: User speaks to Local Client, which streams audio to Voice Bridge via WebSocket
2. **Speech-to-Text**: Voice Bridge sends audio chunks to local STT API for transcription
3. **MQTT Publishing**: Voice Bridge publishes `ClientRequest` with transcribed text to MQTT broker
4. **Intent Analysis**: Intent Analysis Engine receives `ClientRequest`, classifies intent, and publishes `IntentRequest` to MQTT
5. **Distributed Processing**: All skills receive the `IntentRequest` via their MQTT subscriptions
6. **Certainty Evaluation**: Each skill calculates confidence score independently
7. **Selective Processing**: Only skills with certainty ≥ threshold process the request
8. **Response Publishing**: Processing skill publishes `Response` to appropriate MQTT topic
9. **Text-to-Speech**: Voice Bridge receives response, sends text to local TTS API for audio generation
10. **Audio Output**: Voice Bridge streams generated audio + alerts back to Local Client via WebSocket

### Message Routing

- **Targeted responses**: `skill.send_response(text, client_request)`
  - Uses `client_request.output_topic`
  - Sent to specific user/device
- **Broadcast responses**: `skill.broadcast_response(text)`
  - Uses `config.broadcast_topic`  
  - Sent to all connected clients

## Skill Lifecycle

### Initialization
```python
async def mqtt_connection_handler(skill_class, config, **kwargs):
    # 1. Establish MQTT connection with retry logic
    # 2. Create TaskGroup for concurrent operations
    # 3. Initialize skill instance
    # 4. Setup MQTT subscriptions
    # 5. Call skill_preparations() for custom setup
    # 6. Start message listening loop
```

### Runtime
```python
# Main message loop
async def listen_to_messages():
    async for message in mqtt_client.messages:
        if message.topic.matches(intent_topic):
            await handle_client_request_message(payload)

# Request processing pipeline
async def handle_client_request_message(payload):
    intent_request = IntentRequest.parse(payload)

    # Step 1: Check if intent type is in self.supported_intents
    if intent_request.classified_intent.intent_type not in self.supported_intents:
        return  # Skip - not relevant to this skill

    # Step 2: Get per-intent threshold and apply confidence modifiers
    required_confidence = self.supported_intents[intent_request.classified_intent.intent_type]
    effective_threshold = required_confidence

    # Check modifiers via O(1) dict lookup
    modifiers_for_intent = self.confidence_modifiers.get(intent_request.classified_intent.intent_type, [])
    for modifier in modifiers_for_intent:
        if self.skill_context.has_recent_intent(modifier.trigger_intent):
            effective_threshold = min(effective_threshold, modifier.reduced_threshold)

    if intent_request.classified_intent.confidence < effective_threshold:
        return  # Skip - confidence too low

    # Step 3: Check entity matchers (if defined)
    if self.entity_matchers:
        matched = False
        for entity_type, matcher in self.entity_matchers.items():
            entities = intent_request.classified_intent.entities.get(entity_type, [])
            if entities and matcher(entities):
                matched = True
                break
        if not matched:
            return  # Skip - entities don't match

    # All checks passed - process the request
    await process_request(intent_request)

    # Track in context for future threshold adjustments
    self.skill_context.add_action(intent_request.classified_intent.intent_type.value)
```

## Integration Points

### MQTT Topics
- **Intent Results**: `assistant/intent_engine/result`
- **Broadcast**: `assistant/comms_bridge/broadcast`  
- **Skill Feedback**: `assistant/{skill_id}/feedback`

### External Systems
- **Voice Bridge**: Audio input/output via FastAPI WebSocket
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Required for global device registry and skill registration
- **APIs**: Skills can integrate with external services (Home Assistant, Spotify, weather APIs, etc.)

## Device Registry

All skills participate in the global device registry for intent engine pattern matching. The registry enables the intent engine to:
- Match specific devices in voice commands ("turn on bedroom lamp")
- Resolve generic device types ("turn on lights" → all light devices)
- Provide context hints for intent classification

### Database Requirement

**PostgreSQL database is mandatory** for all skills. The database stores:
- Skills: Registered skill instances with unique names
- Device Types: Categories of devices (light, switch, timer, alarm, etc.)
- Devices: Specific devices with pattern strings for NL matching
- Rooms: Optional location associations for devices

### Automatic Registration

Skills are automatically registered during `skill_preparations()`:
1. Skill registration (idempotent by name)
2. Device type registration (from `supported_device_types` list)
3. Devices can then be registered by the skill

**Static Devices** (Timer/Alarm):
```python
class TimerSkill(BaseSkill):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.supported_device_types = ["timer", "alarm"]

    async def skill_preparations(self):
        await super().skill_preparations()  # Auto-registers skill + device types

        # Register static devices
        await self.register_device("timer", "timer", ["timer", "set timer"])
        await self.register_device("alarm", "alarm", ["alarm", "set alarm"])
```

**Dynamic Devices** (Lights from Home Assistant):
```python
class SwitchSkill(BaseSkill):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.supported_device_types = ["light", "switch"]

    async def skill_preparations(self):
        await super().skill_preparations()  # Auto-registers skill + device types

        # Sync devices from external system
        await self._sync_devices_from_home_assistant()

        # Schedule periodic refresh
        self.add_task(self._periodic_device_sync(interval=300))
```

### MQTT Notifications

When devices are registered, skills automatically publish to `assistant/global_device_update` topic, triggering the intent engine to refresh its device cache.

Skills also listen to this topic to reactively refresh their device cache when external systems (like a device management interface) modify devices in the database. This listener runs as a background task started during `skill_preparations()`.

## Configuration Management

Skills use `SkillConfig` for:
- MQTT connection settings
- Topic hierarchy configuration
- Skill-specific settings via YAML files

`PostgresConfig` (required) for database connection:
- Connection string generation for sync/async operations
- Environment variable loading (POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, etc.)
- Used by all skills for device registry access

## Error Handling

### MQTT Resilience
- Automatic reconnection on connection loss
- Configurable retry intervals
- Graceful degradation when services unavailable

### Skill Robustness
- Pydantic validation for all messages
- Structured exception handling
- Comprehensive logging with configurable levels

### Task Management
- TaskGroup automatically handles task cleanup
- Proper cancellation handling
- Resource cleanup on skill shutdown

## Performance Considerations

### Message Processing
- Lightweight certainty calculations for fast filtering
- Async/await throughout for non-blocking operations
- Bounded LRU cache prevents memory leaks with automatic eviction
- Concurrent message processing for improved throughput (2-3x improvement)
- Thread-safe cache access with asyncio.Lock for data integrity

### Resource Management
- Skills only process relevant messages
- Background tasks managed by TaskGroup
- Optional database connections only when needed
- Configurable intent cache size (default: 1000 entries)
- Memory usage remains stable during long-running operations

### Scalability
- Horizontal: Add more skill instances
- Vertical: Skills process multiple messages concurrently
- Topic-based message filtering reduces processing overhead
- Individual message processing errors don't affect other messages

## Security & Privacy

### Local Processing
- No cloud dependencies
- All data stays on local network
- Voice processing entirely local

### Message Security
- MQTT over local network only
- Structured message validation
- No sensitive data in logs

This architecture provides a robust, scalable foundation for building sophisticated voice assistant capabilities while maintaining privacy and local control.
